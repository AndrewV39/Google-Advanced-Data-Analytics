## 🧩 Program Overview
Through seven intensive courses, I developed expertise in:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Statistical testing and regression modeling
- Machine learning (classification, ensemble methods)
- Data visualization and storytelling
- Python programming with pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib
- Communicating business insights to stakeholders

## 📚 Course Projects

### **Course 1: Foundations of Data Analytics**
**Project:** *NYC Taxi Fare Prediction*  
**Summary:** Developed a multiple regression model to predict taxi fares using NYC TLC data.  
**Key Skills:** Regression, data cleaning, visualization, PACE workflow.  
**Tools:** Python, pandas, matplotlib  
**Outcome:** Improved fare estimate accuracy and identified key cost drivers like distance and trip duration.

---

### **Course 2: Get Started with Python**
**Project:** *Automatidata – NYC Taxi Tip Analysis*  
**Summary:** Analyzed 22K taxi trips to uncover tipping behavior using pandas and NumPy.  
**Key Insights:** Credit card users tip $2.73 on average; cash tips are often unrecorded.  
**Tools:** pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib  
**Outcome:** Identified payment type and passenger count as strongest predictors of tipping.

---

### **Course 3: Go Beyond the Numbers – Translate Data into Insights**
**Project:** *Waze User Churn Analysis*  
**Summary:** Conducted EDA on Waze user data to identify patterns related to churn.  
**Key Insights:** Frequent users show lower churn; long-distance drivers are more likely to leave.  
**Tools:** pandas, seaborn, matplotlib  
**Outcome:** Suggested retention strategies for long-distance and low-engagement users.

---

### **Course 4: The Power of Statistics**
**Project:** *TikTok Verified vs. Unverified Accounts – Statistical Testing*  
**Summary:** Performed Welch’s t-test to determine if verified TikTok accounts get more views.  
**Results:** Significant difference (p < 0.05); verified users receive higher view counts.  
**Tools:** pandas, scipy, matplotlib  
**Outcome:** Concluded verification status boosts visibility and engagement.

---

### **Course 5: Regression Analysis – Simplify Complex Data Relationships**
**Project:** *Predicting TikTok Verification Status*  
**Summary:** Built logistic regression model to predict account verification from engagement metrics.  
**Performance:** Accuracy 63%, Recall 0.88.  
**Key Factors:** Comment count positively predicts verification; like count and duration show negative correlation.  
**Tools:** scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy  
**Outcome:** Delivered interpretable model and feature insights for platform analytics.

---

### **Course 6: The Nuts and Bolts of Machine Learning**
**Project:** *Predicting Generous Tippers – NYC Taxi Data*  
**Summary:** Developed Random Forest and XGBoost models to predict if riders would tip ≥20%.  
**Performance:** XGBoost achieved F1 = 0.71, Accuracy = 0.68.  
**Key Drivers:** Fare amount, trip distance, and vendor type.  
**Tools:** scikit-learn, XGBoost, pandas  
**Outcome:** Recommended incentive strategies for drivers based on high-tipping trip profiles.

---

### **Course 7: Capstone Project – Salifort Motors Employee Turnover**
**Project:** *Employee Attrition Prediction with Machine Learning*  
**Summary:** Built classification models to predict employee turnover using HR data.  
**Performance:** Random Forest model achieved 98.1% accuracy with balanced precision and recall.  
**Key Factors:** Employee satisfaction, project load, tenure, and monthly hours.  
**Tools:** pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
**Outcome:** Provided data-driven HR recommendations to reduce attrition and improve retention.
